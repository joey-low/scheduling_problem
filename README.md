#### This is an analysis which optimize the number of days examinations should be held given a number of candidates and choices of subjects

#### The requirements is that no more than 30 exam can happen on a given day and it should happen in minimum days

#### This analysis makes assumption that half a day is alloted for each subject. Ideal number of days examinations should be held is minimum 3.3 days or maximum 50 days

#### Data is generated by sampling 500 sets of subjects of choice, where each set is where a candidate selects 6 subjects out of 100 subjects offered

#### The distribution is normalized to represent the proportion of subjects selected by the 500 candidates

#### Subjects with proportion of less than or equal to 5th percentile (or 0.042) will be considered as subjects which can be clashed. 7 subjects are with proportion of less than or equal to 0.042

#### Binomial cumulative distribution function outputs 99.42% chances that at most 2 subjects which can be clashed be among the 6 subjects of choice

#### These 2 subjects are split to 2 slots as no candidate can sit for 2 subjects at the same time

#### 7 subjects which can be clashed is therefore split to 2 slots. With each slot consisting of 3 or 4 combinations of subjects which can be clashed, the combinations with minimum product of subject proportion is selected so the chance of a candidate sitting for 2 subjects which can be clashed within the same slot is at its minimum

#### The number of days examinations should be held based on the analysis which covers 95% of the candidates is 47.5 days
